### Getting Started ###

In order to recreate the results shown in my report, please clone the following repo from github.

https://github.com/donaldtf/ml-randomized-optimization

Or you can just use this command to clone it via ssh: `git@github.com:donaldtf/ml-randomized-optimization.git`

This repo contains all the code needed to reproduce my results, including the data sets that were used. The project structure looks like this:

/data - this holds the two data sets (hmeq and pulsar_stars) that are used with each algorithm
/images - learning curves for each algorithm are output into this directory
/iteration_curves - this holds the iteration_curves for the algorithms that have an iterative component
/reports - while running each algorithm, I feed the standard output into a report file here instead of to the console.
           This file holds stats on grid search results, test data performance and wall clock times
/utils.py - this is a utility file that holds shared functionality between the algorithms 
            (loading and prepping data, plotting learning curves, etc)


### Install Dependencies ###

The code relies on the following dependencies in order to run. You can install them via your favorite method (conda, pip, etc.).

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

The last dependency is mlrose. This will need to be installed via pip. See the readme here for installation instructions: https://github.com/gkhayes/mlrose

Once these are all installed you should be ready to run the code


### Running the code ###

Running the code is simple once you have your dependencies installed. If you want to run a specific algorithm, simply run:

`python {algorithm}.py` where algorithm is the name of the file you want to run. The available files are

- neural_network.py

Alternatively, if you would like to run all of the algorithms in bulk you can simply run:

`python run_all.py`

Note: Running all of the algorithms at once may take several minutes (5 - 10 minutes, depending on your machine) to complete.
Side Note: When generating iteration graphs, you may see warnings that the function finished before it converged
I was unable to remove these errors, but it is fine they are there since lower max_iter numbers are used purposefully for
plotting purposes.
